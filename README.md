A Christmas-themed interactive web experience built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. The page features a dark, elegant festive interface with a music selection menu allowing users to choose predefined Christmas songs or upload their own audio. When music plays, a real-time audio visualizer renders a glowing winter scene including animated snowfall, luminous particle planes, and stylized Christmas trees made of thousands of particles that react dynamically to audio frequencies. The scene uses WebGL, custom shaders, additive blending, bloom post-processing effects, and smooth camera perspective to create a cinematic Christmas light concert atmosphere. Users can return to the menu at any time to switch music, maintaining a seamless interactive experience.
